# Macro Map — MVP, Roadmap, Development Phases, Module Layout & Simplicity Rules

## 1. MVP feature list

The MVP is one sentence: **track your macros, and everything you can discover you can log.**

| Included | Notes |
|---|---|
| Accounts + onboarding | All 7 tracking styles; calculated targets + manual override |
| Profiles + privacy matrix | Opt-in modules present but minimal styling |
| Follow + friend requests + block | No DMs |
| Home feed (Following/Friends/Trending) + posts + comments + reactions | All post types that don't depend on unbuilt systems |
| Recipe submission, detail, discovery, votes, saves, ratings, tried, **log-to-diary** | Ingredient-linked macro calculation; provenance badges; corrections = simple report-to-creator flow (voting on corrections is phase 2) |
| Macro tracker | kcal/P/C/F/fiber/sugar/sodium/water, barcode scan, saved meals, copy day/meal, weekly averages, adherence, streaks |
| Restaurant DB + optimizer | Admin-imported top chains; **"Around me" concatenated cross-chain item list ranked against remaining macros** as the default view; **item builder ("build a bowl") for build-line chains** (Chipotle, Subway, Cava…) with live macro tally, log, and save-as-go-to-order; per-chain browse + item rankings. Geolocation via browser API; no map tiles in MVP. See [06 §7a–7b](06-recipes-voting-reputation.md) |
| Workout logging + community workouts | Logger with PR detection; publish/save/complete/fork workouts; template shelf |
| Progress tracking | Weight/measurements/photos (private), charts, milestone share prompts |
| Groups + challenges | Public groups; auto-scored challenge metrics + custom check-in |
| Grocery lists from recipes/preps | Dedupe + sections + cost estimate |
| Meal prep plans | Compose from recipes; boards as saved filters |
| Admin: reports queue, user management, macro verification, CSV import | The minimum to run a UGC platform safely |
| Notifications (in-app inbox only) | No push/email in MVP |

**Explicitly out of MVP:** DMs, grocery-list sharing, correction voting, restaurant-request voting, pantry, coach mode, monetization, wearables, push notifications, PDF auto-extraction, dedicated search engine, native apps.

## 2. Future roadmap

**Phase 2 — deepen the loops (post-launch quarter):** DMs + friend accountability nudges · correction voting + community-mod role · restaurant request voting + community item submission at scale · grocery list sharing · progress photo timeline compare/export · push + email notifications (same `notifications` rows) · repost/share-with-comment.

**Phase 3 — ecosystem:** coach mode (client roster, shared logs with consent, check-in reviews) · creator pages + verified creators · advanced groups (private content collections) · advanced challenge types + sponsored challenges · pantry tracking ("what can I prep with what I have") · premium analytics.

**Phase 4 — platform:** mobile apps (React Native/Expo against `/api/v1`) · health-platform sync and app-data import (below) · local events + gym communities · dedicated search · monetization rollout.

### Health integrations & data import (planned design)

**Apple Health / Google Fit** (requires the native app — HealthKit has no web API; this is a headline reason the mobile app exists):
- *Read into MacroMap:* weight & body-fat (→ `progress_entries`, auto-filling weigh-ins), steps (→ challenges + progress), workouts & active energy (→ `workout_logs`), sleep (→ progress).
- *Write out:* logged nutrition (calories/macros) and workouts, so MacroMap plays nicely as the source of truth in the user's health graph.
- Sync model: an `integration_accounts` table (provider, scopes, tokens/anchors) + idempotent upserts keyed by provider sample id; conflicts resolve "most-specific-source wins" (manual entry beats synced).
- Same table/pattern extends to **Strava/Garmin** (OAuth, workout import) and **smart scales** later.

**Import from other tracking apps** (earlier — Phase 2–3, no native app needed, big switching-cost killer):
- File importers for **MyFitnessPal, MacroFactor, Cronometer, Lose It** CSV exports, plus a generic CSV mapper: upload → staging table → column mapping preview (reusing the admin nutrition-import wizard UI) → dry-run diff → commit into `food_logs` (as macro snapshots — no food matching required for history) and `progress_entries` (weight).
- Imported history is flagged `source='import:mfp'` so analytics can distinguish it; streaks/adherence recompute over it, so a switcher lands with their trend charts intact on day one.
- Export symmetrically: full CSV export of logs/progress already committed in the GDPR-shaped data-export requirement ([02 §7](02-architecture.md)).

**Monetization (when the community is real, not before):** freemium core (tracking + community forever free — the community *is* the moat; paywalling contribution kills it). Premium ($/mo): advanced analytics (trend modeling, adherence forecasting), calorie banking+, unlimited saved meals/lists, ad-free. Creator subscriptions (premium recipe packs/programs, revenue share). Coach tools (per-client pricing). Team/gym plans. Sponsored challenges + restaurant partnerships (clearly labeled). Grocery affiliate links on grocery lists. **Never sell:** ranking placement, health data.

## 3. Development phases (solo-dev-with-Claude sized)

| Phase | Scope | Exit criterion |
|---|---|---|
| **0. Foundation** (wk 1–2) | Next.js + Drizzle + Auth.js scaffold, schema migrated, seed scripts (USDA foods subset, exercises, tags, top-10 chains), design tokens + core components, media presign pipeline | Sign up → onboard → see targets |
| **1. Tracker** (wk 3–5) | Food search/barcode/log, tracker screen, saved meals, copy ops, streaks/adherence, progress entries + charts | A user can track a full week; *usable product for 1 person* |
| **2. Recipes** (wk 6–9) | Recipe CRUD + ingredients + provenance, discovery + filters, votes/saves/ratings/tried, log-recipe, grocery lists, hot/quality cron | Discover → save → groceries → log loop works |
| **3. Social** (wk 10–13) | Profiles, follow/friend/block, posts/comments/reactions, home feed, notifications inbox, milestone share prompts | Two accounts can fully interact |
| **4. Workouts + restaurants** (wk 14–17) | Workout logger + PRs, community workouts, templates; chains/menu items + rankings + go-to orders + CSV import | Both loggable content verticals live |
| **5. Community + safety** (wk 18–20) | Groups, challenges + auto-scoring, meal preps, reports + admin dashboard, rate limits, content warnings | Safe to open to strangers |
| **6. Beta hardening** (wk 21–22) | Playwright on critical flows, perf pass on feed/discovery queries, seed content push, copy/ED-safety review | Public beta |

Each phase ships behind nothing — the app is deployable and self-usable from Phase 1 onward. That ordering is deliberate: the tracker must be excellent *before* social, because the social layer's currency (logs, adherence, PRs) is minted by the tracker.

## 5. Keeping it simple instead of bloated

The spec above lists hundreds of features. The build survives only if the *systems* stay few:

1. **One social primitive.** Votes/saves/reactions/comments/reports/tags are each ONE polymorphic table + ONE service + ONE component. A new content type costs a schema table and a card component — never new interaction machinery. If a feature needs a new interaction type, that's a smell.
2. **Boards are queries, not features.** "Best budget meal prep," "trending this week," "best protein-per-calorie" — all are saved filter+sort presets over the same two ranked orderings. Zero new tables, zero new services per board.
3. **Everything loggable goes through one path.** Recipes, menu items, foods, saved meals all end as a `food_logs` snapshot row. One logging service, one add-food UI, one macro math module (`lib/units`).
4. **Milestones are detected, posts are offered.** No separate "milestone system" — PR/streak/weigh-in detection lives where the data is written, and produces a pre-filled post draft. The feed stays one system.
5. **Defer every second system.** No Redis, no queue, no search engine, no map tiles, no push, no DMs in MVP — each has a named trigger metric in [02-architecture §9](02-architecture.md) and a designed seam. Deferred ≠ unplanned.
6. **Cut personalization ML forever until proven needed.** Goal-fit is arithmetic over macros. It's explainable to users ("shown because it fits your remaining 42 g protein") which is itself a feature.
7. **Feature gate by phase, not by flag sprawl.** Ship whole verticals in order (tracker → recipes → social…). Avoid half-built everything.
8. **The 80/20 screens get the polish budget:** Track, Add Food, Recipe Detail, Feed. Every other screen can be plain. Users live in four screens; the rest are visited.
9. **Copy the privacy check, never reimplement it.** `privacy.ts` (`canView`, `serializeProfile`) is the single gate. PRs adding a second visibility check get rejected.
10. **When in doubt, make it a post.** Grocery hauls, restaurant finds, questions, tips — these are post types with a tag, not features. The list of post types can grow tenfold without the system growing at all.
